# An analysis of Electric Energy Consumption.

## Objective
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption patterns across different building types. The goal is to identify inefficiencies, understand key influencing factors, and suggest strategies for energy optimization. The dashboard is built using Power BI to enable interactive visualization and real-time monitoring of energy usage.

## Analysis Conducted
- **Energy Consumption by Building Type** – Compared usage across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.
- **Energy Consumption vs. Square Footage** – Analyzed the relationship between building size and energy usage.
- **Weekdays vs. Weekends Comparison** – Examined energy consumption differences between workdays and weekends.
- **Impact of Occupants on Energy Consumption** – Investigated how the number of occupants affects energy usage.
- **Appliance Usage Analysis** – Assessed the role of appliance usage in overall energy consumption.
- **Effect of Temperature Variations** – Explored how external temperature impacts energy demand.

## Key Insights
- **Industrial buildings** consume the highest energy, followed by commercial and residential sectors.
- **Larger buildings** have proportionally higher energy usage.
- **Energy consumption is higher on weekdays** than weekends, indicating peak usage during business operations.
- **More occupants lead to increased energy consumption**, especially in residential and commercial buildings.
- **Appliance usage significantly influences energy demand**, emphasizing the need for energy-efficient appliances.
- **Temperature fluctuations impact energy consumption.**

This dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions for energy conservation and cost reduction strategies.
