Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
This project is an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built using Excel, aimed at providing insights into road accident trends and patterns. The dashboard utilizes pivot tables, charts, and slicers to analyze data, helping to visualize key factors such as accident severity, causes, location, and vehicle involvement.

Features:
Visual representation of accident trends over time.
Breakdown of accidents by severity (minor, serious, fatal).
Analysis of accident causes and conditions (weather, road type).
Insights into vehicle type involvement in accidents.
Interactive slicers for filtering data by year, severity, vehicle type, and location.
Objective:
The primary goal of the dashboard is to assist in identifying high-risk factors and provide actionable insights to help reduce road accidents and improve safety.
